Restoring Nature Wildlife Conservation In Landscapes Fragmented By Plantation Crops,979,"Agricultural expansion has historically been a major global cause for the loss and fragmentation of natural ecosystems, and remains one of the largest threats to the world's remaining tropical forests today. In tropical regions, conservation concerns have arisen over the implications of the anticipated increase in the area under agriculture by as much as twenty-five percent. Concomitant with biodiversity loss due to extinctions, the loss of tropical forests may lead to decrease in ecosystem services of great value to humanity such as carbon storage in biomass and soils, watershed regulation and rainfall, modulation of climate and river flows, and amelioration of infectious disease and human-wildlife conflicts.

"Restoring Rainforest Fragments: Survival of Mixed-Native Species Seedlings under Contrasting Site Conditions in the Western Ghats, India",,"Historical fragmentation and a current annual deforestation rate of 1.2% in the Western Ghats biodiversity hotspot have resulted in a human-dominated landscape of plantations, agriculture, and developed areas, with embedded rainforest fragments that form biodiversity refuges and animal corridors. On private lands in the Anamalai hills, India, we established restoration sites within three rainforest fragments (5, 19, and 100 ha) representing varying levels of degradation such as open meadow, highly degraded sites with dense Lantana camara invasion, abandoned exotic tree plantations (Eucalyptus grandis and Maesopsis eminii), and sites with mixed-native and exotic tree canopy. Between 2000 and 2004, we planted annually during the southwest monsoon 7,538 nursery-raised seedlings of around 127 species in nine sites (0.15–1.0 ha). Seedlings monitored at 6-monthly intervals showed higher mortality over the dry season than the wet season and survival rates over a 2-year period of between 34.4 and 90.3% under different site conditions. Seedling survival was higher in sites with complete weed removal as against partial removal along planting lines and higher in open meadow and under shade than in sites that earlier had dense weed invasion. Of 44 species examined, survival across sites after 24 months for a majority of species (27 species, 61.4%) was higher than 50%. Retaining regenerating native species during weed clearing operations was crucial for rapid reestablishment of a first layer of canopy to shade out weeds and enhance survival of shade-tolerant rainforest seedlings.",,,,era_ad,publish,,,standard,closed,closed,,0,0,"10.33016, 76.95985",https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Restoration-Ecology-Raman-Mudappa-Kapoor-2009-Arjun-Singh.pdf,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1FOUrCO8-Eriiqdmug0ceLwbxwemVPT2J,Anamalai Rainforest Restoration,Tamil Nadu,,,2009,During,South Western Ghats montane rain forests,English,"Divya Mudappa, T.R.

Tropical forest restoration in the Eastern Himalaya: Evaluating early survival and growth of native tree species,,"Asian tropical forests have among the highest rates of forest loss in the world. Ecological restoration is a vital step for biodiversity maintenance and climate change mitigation. For restoration practice, evaluation of species performance at early stages is crucial to avoid failure of the efforts and for screening species suitable to a region. Though the long-term performance of restoration plantings has been well-documented, few studies have evaluated the performance during the establishment of the planted saplings, especially in South and Southeast Asia. Restoration efforts in Northeast India, a region experiencing high forest loss, is limited by the lack of species-specific data on survival and growth. We compared inter-specific variation in seasonal survival and growth rates (diameter and height) for multiple native rainforest species from this region. We planted 3022 saplings of 50 species at a degraded open forest site. After 18 months, sapling survival varied between 9.1–94.3% for 32 species, and only six species showed “excellent” survival after 18 months. Eight out of 17 species that were tested for seasonal variation in survival showed significant differences in survival between seasons. While the diameter growth rate varied for species between seasons, the height growth rate was different between both species and season, but the interaction term between species and season was not significant. Certain animal-dispersed, medium to large-seeded primary forest species performed well and are vital for future restoration efforts in this region.",,,,era_ad,publish,,,standard,closed,closed,,0,0,"27.082969, 92.816041",https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Borawake-et-al_2021_Tropical-forest-restoration-in-the-Eastern-Himalaya-Evaluating-early-survival-and-growth-of-native-tree-species.pdf,https://drive.google.com/open?id=1XF7AhlNTSZ4WN6KUUDEO2Jld0qOFOjcj,Tropical forest restoration in the Eastern Himalaya,Arunachal Pradesh,,,2021,Starting,Eastern Himalayan broadleaf forests,English,"Noopur Borawake, Aparajita Datta, Rohit Naniwadekar",,,,,,Publication,"2021,Publication",,Tropical forest restoration in the Eastern Himalaya: Evaluating early survival and growth of native tree species,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
