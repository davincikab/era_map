"Deccan thorn scrub forests","5526","This large, semi-arid region, primarily situated on the Deccan Plateau, is characterised by sparsely vegetated, thorn forest or savanna like forests. The ecoregion has a complex and diverse geological history influencing the unique formations in the region. Strong edaphic factors, a low rainfall and harsh climate has resulted in a specialised diverse group of plants and animals adapted to the rocky outcrops and hill ranges and the various basins and biogeographic regions of the scrub ecosystem. This region houses the floodplains and basins of most of the major rivers of peninsular India.

The remaining scattered forest fragments suggest that the forests were once dominated by Sal <em>Shorea robusta</em>, in association with <em>Terminalia, Lagerstroemia, Adina, Dillenia,</em> and <em>Ficus</em>, as in ‘typical’ deciduous forests in this sub-Himalayan region. Patches of grasslands dominated by tall <em>Saccharum</em> grasses, wild sugar cane, could be found where the floodwaters prevented trees from taking hold. Natural forest remains in the Rajaji, Corbett, and Dudwa national parks.",,"2022-07-11 14:26:04","upper-gangetic-plains-moist-deciduous-forests","era_ad","publish",,,"standard","closed","closed",,"0","0","Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC","<a href=""https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/upper-gangetic-plains-moist-deciduous-forests/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/upper-gangetic-plains-moist-deciduous-forests/</a>",,,,,,,"Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows","5573","This ecoregion represents the alpine meadows and shrublands between 3,000 and 5,000 m in the western Himalaya, mainly in Himachal Pradesh and Uttarakhand. A fourth of this ecoregion is bare rock and ice on high peaks. The alpine shrubby flora is dominated by colourful, dwarf rhododendrons, while the meadows have a rich herbaceous community of <em>Anaphalis, Aster, Cynanthus, Jurinea, Morina, Potentilla, Gentiana, Delphinium, Gentiana, Meconopsis, Pedicularis, Anemone, Polygonum, Primula,</em> and <em>Saussurea</em>. Willows line the montane streams. The ecoregion contains several hotspots of floral diversity and endemism, notably the Valley of Flowers, Nanda Devi, Tinker Valley, Dhorpatan, and Annapurna. Eleven reserves, including Shey-Phuksundo, Annapurna, Kedarnath, Nanda Devi, and Dhorpatan, cover about 25% of the ecoregion area.",,"2022-07-11 14:26:04","western-himalayan-alpine-shrub-and-meadows","era_ad","publish",,,"standard","closed","closed",,"0","0","Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC","<a href=""https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/western-himalayan-alpine-shrub-and-meadows/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/western-himalayan-alpine-shrub-and-meadows/</a>",,,,,,,"Western Himalayan alpine shrub and meadows",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Western Himalayan broadleaf forests","5574","This ecoregion is a narrow band between 1,500 and 2,600 m, starting from the Kali Gandaki River gorge in Central Nepal through northwestern India into Pakistan. An important zone for altitudinal migrants. The ecoregion has two distinct forest types. The evergreen broad-leaved forests are dominated by oaks—<em>Quercus semecarpifolia, Q. dilatata, Q. lamellosa,</em> and <em>Q. incana</em>—that grow on the moister southern slopes, more influenced by the monsoon. The oak forests on drier and higher slopes are mixed with various conifers, such as fir, abies, spruce, cedar, and pines, with a bamboo understory of <em>Arundinaria</em> species. The deciduous broadleaf forests are composed of walnut, Himalayan horse chestnut, alder, maple, Himalayan poplar, Himalayan elm, and Turkish hazel.",,"2022-07-11 14:26:04","western-himalayan-broadleaf-forests","era_ad","publish",,,"standard","closed","closed",,"0","0","Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC","<a href=""https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/western-himalayan-broadleaf-forests/"" target=""_blank"" rel=""noopener noreferrer"">https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/western-himalayan-broadleaf-forests/</a>",,,,,,,"Western Himalayan broadleaf forests",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
"Western Himalayan subalpine conifer forests","5575","A transitional zone (3,000 – 3,500 m) between forested Himalayan ecoregions and treeless alpine meadows and boulder-strewn screes, from Western Kashmir to eastern Uttarakhand. Conifer forests in the drier west, with blue pine, chilgoza pine, fir, silver fir, and spruce are more diverse and extensive than those in the moister eastern ranges. Seasonal, with about 1,500 mm precipitation, drier in the west with a lower treeline (3,300 m) than in the east (4,000 m). The ecoregion has pure fir forest; mixed oak-fir forest; mixed rhododendron, fir, and birch forest; and mixed coniferous forests with fir, blue pine, and spruce. Cypress and Himalayan cedar or deodar are common above 2,400 m.

"Yarlung Zanbo arid steppe","5576","A small area at the northernmost edge of Sikkim falls within this ecoregion. Mostly dominated by cold desert steppe at higher elevations changing lower down to deciduous scrub. Lower than other parts of the Tibetan Plateau, it has more moderate valley climate, mean annual temperatures 4 – 8°C, and annual precipitation of 200 – 500 mm. Potential vegetation is steppe grassland with scattered shrubs and herbs in the Genera <em>Sophora, Leptodermis, Ceratostigma,</em> and <em>Artemisia</em>. Cold steppe vegetation above 4,000 m has <em>Stipa</em> feather grass, honeysuckle shrubs, and<em> Potentilla fruticosa </em>in the east and <em>Caragana</em>, a spiny legume, in the west.
