It has near-evergreen scrub of stunted birch and Rhododendron, meadows with diverse herb and grass community, and bare scree habitats with cushion-forming plants such as Caragana, Saxifraga, and Draba."
39,Aravalli west thorn scrub forests,Overview (Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC),https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/aravalli-west-thorn-scrub-forests/,"This ecoregion occurs in northwestern India, along the Aravalli Mountains (formed over 1,500 million years ago). The stunted, xerophytic (adapted to dryness) vegetation, dominated by species of Acacia (< 6 m in height), includes trees and shrubs such as Prosopis cineraria, Grewia, Salvadora, Zizyphus, Anogeissus, Gardenia, Capparis, and Carissa. Climbers such as Tragia, Rivea, Tinospora, Vitis, and Peristrophe also occur. The thorn forests transition in drier areas into cactus-like Euphorbia scrub. Near the coast where soils are more saline Salvadora and Tamarix occur, while areas with very high salinity lack vegetation. Climatically, the region is dry, with an average annual rainfall of about 750 mm in the northern areas and about 950 mm further south."
40,Orissa semi-evergreen forests,Overview (Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC),https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/orissa-semi-evergreen-forests/,"Like all other ecoregions of the Deccan Plateau, the flora and fauna of the Orissa Semi-Evergreen ecoregion has an ancient geological lineage with Gondwanaland origins, but now represents the forests along the low hills in the northeastern Indian State of Orissa. Five distinct vegetation forms are recognizable based on the dominant tree species. All of them are represented by Sal, or Shorea robusta, The ‘typical’ tree community of these forests include species of Artocarpus, Michelia, Bridelia, Ficus, and Mangifera. Patches of canebrakes and bamboo brakes break up the homogeneity of the forests."
41,Pamir alpine desert and tundra,Overview (Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC),https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/pamir-alpine-desert-and-tundra/,"This ecoregion includes broad valleys and steeply rolling hills with an ecological and physiographic similarity to the Tibetan Plateau. The areas are instead situated at a mean elevation of about 4,200 m, substantially lower (and warmer) than the high basins of northwestern Tibet. Several cold-desert plant associations have been identified for the Pamir region, including low, branching shrubs, cushion plants, dense turf-forming grasses, and Kobresia sedge barrens. Some key species are Rhodiola, Saussurea, Tanacetum, and Saxifraga."
42,Rann of Kutch seasonal salt marsh,Overview (Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC),https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/rann-of-kutch-seasonal-salt-marsh/,"This ecoregion represents the saline wetlands and mudflats at the mouth of the Luni River that flows down from the Aravalli Hills in northwestern India. Most of the ecoregion lies within Gujarat in India. The vegetation of the Great and Little Ranns—‘Rann’ meaning desert in Hindi—consists of grasses, thorny xerophytic scrub and short tangled trees. Sedges, dominated by species of Cyperus and Scirpus, emerge from the flooded areas. The surrounding areas have small perennial shrubs and mat-forming plants, such as Cressa cretica and Aeluropus lagopoides, the latter known as mangrove grass. The vegetation in the bets (sandy, high-ground areas) have halophytic, or salt-loving, shrubby seablights such as Suaeda fruticosa and S. nudiflora."
43,Sundarbans freshwater swamp forests,Overview (Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC),https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/sundarbans-freshwater-swamp-forests/,"This almost extinct ecoregion, intensely exploited, cultivated and built over with dense human populations is in the vast delta formed by the confluence of several of South Asia’s largest rivers. It includes swamp forests surrounding the Sundarbans Mangroves, in the zone where the freshwater from the rivers push back the saline waters of the intruding ocean. This ecoregion also straddles the political boundary between Bangladesh and India’s state of West Bengal. Forest and habitat loss are so extensive that it is difficult to ascertain the composition of the original vegetation of this ecoregion. Historical records suggest that the forests used to have mangrove tree species of Heritiera, Xylocarpus, Bruguiera, Avicennia, and Sonneratia."
44,Sundarbans mangroves,Overview (Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC),https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/sundarbans-mangroves/,"This ecoregion lies in a vast delta spanning over 10,000 sq km formed by the confluence of the Ganga, Hooghly, Padma, Brahmaputra, and Meghna. Strong monsoons from the Bay of Bengal bring heavy rains and devastating cyclones that cause widespread destruction. Annual rainfall exceeds 3,500 mm, and monsoon daytime temperatures can reach a stifling 48°C. The mangroves are not as diverse as other forest types but have a dense canopy and an undergrowth of seedlings and saplings of the canopy trees. While the tree community is dominated by Heritiera, other mangrove trees include species of Avicennia, Xylocarpus, Sonneratia, Bruguiera, Cereops, Aegicera, and Rhizophora. Nipa, a palm adapted to estuaries and mangroves, line the channels."
45,Terai-Duar savanna and grasslands,Overview (Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC),https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/terai-duar-savanna-and-grasslands/,"This ecoregion at the base of the Himalaya supports the world's tallest grasslands from northwest India across to Assam. Key vegetation features are the savannas and tall grasslands (with species like Saccharum spontaneum, S. bengalense, Themeda arundinacea) in a mosaic of evergreen and deciduous broadleaf forests with trees such as sal Shorea robusta, Trewia nudiflora, and Bombax ceiba, corresponding to different moisture conditions. Hot, humid, and wet during the summer monsoon, with temperatures reaching 40ºC, the climate is cooler in the winter, with morning ground frost and fogs. Annual monsoon floods are crucial for maintaining the grasslands, because it clears and flushes the floodplain of encroaching trees, deposits a layer of sand and silt (alluvium) and allows grasses to regenerate."
46,Thar desert,Overview (Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC),https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/thar-desert/,"The Thar Desert ecoregion lies to the west of the Aravalli Mountain Range in the northwestern Indian States of Gujarat, Rajasthan, extending across the border to the Punjab and Sind regions of Pakistan. It is considered to be the 9th largest subtropical desert. The climate is extreme: winter temperatures approach freezing, while summer temperatures soar over 50°C. Rainfall is limited to 100-500 mm from July to September but is very variable. About a tenth of the ecoregion are sand dunes, while the rest is craggy rock formations and compacted salt-lake bottoms. Vegetation has plants adapted to arid conditions including trees and shrubs like Khejri Prosopis cineraria, Balanites roxburghii, Capparis decidua, Euphorbia caducifolia, and Leptadenia pyrotechnica, besides herbs and grasses."
47,Upper Gangetic Plains moist deciduous forests,Overview (Source: Modified from One Earth CC BY-NC),https://www.oneearth.org/ecoregions/upper-gangetic-plains-moist-deciduous-forests/,"This ecoregion in the fertile alluvial plains of the River Ganga is densely populated, extensively cleared, and cultivated. The Ganges flows east to join the Brahmaputra with hardly any topographic relief, except for sloping banks and ravines carved by the river. The substrate consists of deep alluvial soils and deposited on the floodplain. The remaining scattered forest fragments suggest that the forests were once dominated by Sal Shorea robusta, in association with Terminalia, Lagerstroemia, Adina, Dillenia, and Ficus, as in ‘typical’ deciduous forests in this sub-Himalayan region. Patches of grasslands dominated by tall Saccharum grasses, wild sugar cane, could be found where the floodwaters prevented trees from taking hold. Natural forest remains in the Rajaji, Corbett, and Dudwa national parks."
