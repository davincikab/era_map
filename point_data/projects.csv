"Anamalai Rainforest Restoration","2074","Our efforts to ecologically restore rainforests in the Western Ghats sprung from a motivation to conserve the diversity of native plants and animals in this biodiversity hotspot. Much rainforest in the region remains as fragments or patches embedded in plantations of tea, coffee, eucalyptus, and other crops. Many of these fragments are degraded and overrun by weeds due to past disturbances such as logging, fuel wood collection or cultivation. We, from the Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF) established a Rainforest Research Station in the Valparai Plateau of the Anamalai Hills in 2001. In the middle of Tiger Reserves, National Parks and Reserved Forests, the Valparai Plateau spreads over an area of 220 square kilometres. It contains around 50 rainforest fragments of varying sizes (1-300 ha)—remnants of extensive conversion of mid-elevation tropical rainforest to tea and coffee estates between 1890 and 1930. A remarkable diversity of species also remains in the landscape, including endemic and endangered animals such as lion-tailed macaques, Nilgiri martens, Anamalai gliding frogs and Malabar grey hornbills.

As ecologists working in this region, we discovered that even small rainforest fragments were rich in biodiversity, especially if they retained rainforest trees, a dense canopy, and diverse native plant species indicating better habitat quality. Our work suggested that enhancing the multi-tiered structure and diversity of the degraded fragments through ecological restoration could help recover the habitat quality and conserve biodiversity.

Bringing back a complex ecosystem like the rainforest posed a big challenge. Inspired by rainforest restoration projects in the Atherton Tableland in Australia and other parts of the world, we decided to take up the challenge in the Anamalai Hills. Our earlier studies in the rainforests of the Kalakad-Mundanthurai Tiger Reserve informed our understanding of what well-preserved rainforest ecosystems were like, while the Manamboli and Akkamalai rainforests in the Anamalais became a local benchmark to understand species and plant communities native to this area.

In 2001, we started off by signing memorandum of understanding (MoUs) with three companies: Hindustan Unilever Limited (now Tea Estates India Ltd), Parry Agro Industries Limited, and Tata Coffee Limited. The MoUs recognised about 1075 ha of rainforest in 35 rainforest fragments for rainforest restoration, wildlife conservation, and scientific research. We began to work with or alongside the Forest Department, planters, tea estate workers, residents of Valparai, and others.

We established a native plant nursery, a key facility for any restoration project. The nursery, presently at Varattuparai in land provided by a partner, Tata Coffee, is a hub of year-round activity. We collect seeds from roadsides and trails where their chances of survival are very low. This also avoids disturbance of natural regeneration within forests. In this fully organic rainforest nursery, we have managed to raise about 170 native species. It presently stocks around 40,000 saplings of about 90 species.

Each year, during the dry season we identify and prepare the restoration sites in about 4-5 hectares of degraded rainforest fragments. We remove invasive weeds such as <em>Lantana camara</em>, taking care to retain native plants, and erect temporary fencing, if required. Then, during the monsoon, we plant a high diversity mix (40-80 native species) of 2- to 4-year old nursery-raised saplings. For the next year or two, the sites are maintained and monitored as they recover. Between 2001 and 2021, we restored about 100 ha of rainforests planting over 80,000 tree saplings of over 150 native species. A larger area within the fragments is protected for natural regeneration. Thousands of native tree species saplings have also been supplied to tea and coffee plantations for use as shade trees in the surrounding landscape.

Over 20 years of monitoring, our research indicates that active ecological restoration has led to a substantial recovery in plant diversity, forest structure, and carbon storage, besides recovery of rainforest birds. Our knowledge base on seed germination, restoration methods, forest recovery, and plant-animal interactions continues to grow. The first trees we planted have started to flower, fruit, and their dispersing seeds are growing into trees of the future. Ecological restoration requires such sustained and long-term commitment to be effective.",,"2022-05-27 20:31:03","anamalai-rainforest-restoration","era_ad","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/03-Research_Phenology_IMG_20210701_123314-ArjunSingh.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","South Western Ghats montane rainforests","Tamil Nadu","2001–Ongoing","Valparai Plateau, Anamalai hills","Nature Conservation Foundation","1075 hectares in 35 fragments","Actinodaphne malabarica,Canarium strictum,Cinnamomum malabatrum,Cullenia exarillata,Diospyros sylvatica,Elaeocarpus tuberculatus,Heritiera papilio,Litsea nigrescens,Mesua ferrea,Palaquium ellipticum","<a href=""https://www.ncf-india.org/western-ghats/reviving-the-rainforest"">https://www.ncf-india.org/western-ghats/reviving-the-rainforest</a>","NCF, 8/364 Cooperative Colony, Valparai- 642127, Tamil Nadu","Srinivasan K., Kshama B., Anand Osuri., Moorthy T., Sunderraj, Sumathi T., Muthulaxmi, Rajesh, Sathish A.","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/01-KalyanVarma_DJI00263-Arjun-Singh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/02-KalyanVarma_DJI00272-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/03-Research_Phenology_IMG_20210701_123314-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/04-Seedcollectionatfragmentedge-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/08-Lion-tailedMacaque_TRShankarRaman_Valparai-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/10-GreatHornbillsinflightovercanopy_DilanMandanna-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/09-HS-6199-Rhacophoruspseudomalabaricus-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/05-Nursery_Ormosiatravancoricagerminating_DSCN5915-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/07-Restorationplanting_IMG_2923-ArjunSingh.jpg","divya@ncf-india.org","<p>Biodiversity conservation, ecosystem recovery and climate mitigation</p>

"Ecological restoration in the Tiruvannamalai region","2078","The Forest Way grew out of work begun in 2003 to address this situation. Even earlier efforts by both the Forest Department and other local groups had shown that it was possible to grow trees once more on the Hill, but without dealing with the annual fires, the benefit of these efforts was always localized.

Our aim is not simply a return of tree cover to the Hill, but a broader restoration of its complex ecosystems. We know that life desperately wants of live. Nature has an immense power to heal itself if only given the chance. The best use of resources is usually to simply protect and allow the forest to return. At the same time, we strongly feel that people can have an active and positive part to play in helping the forests return. When people do this, it not only helps the forest, but gives great value to the lives of those who partake in this wonderful process.

So our work encompasses active prevention of fire on the hill, raising and planting out trees and other plants, protection, education, community action, continual observation and artistic enjoyment. We aim to let nature dictate our actions, and to let natural feedback prove or disprove those actions.

Successful prevention of fire has taken place through co-operation with the Forest Department and young volunteers. The result has been that forests are returning rapidly across the entire hill. Increases in bird and animal life further affirm that positive change is underway. Tree planting augments and speeds up this process, and bringing local schoolchildren to this young forest and allowing them to form a bond with it lays down further connections that will protect the trees in years to come.",,"2022-05-27 20:31:06","ecological-restoration-in-the-tiruvannamalai-region","era_ad","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/05-Plantingexercise-ArunV.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","South Deccan Plateau dry deciduous forests","Tamil Nadu","2003–Ongoing","Tiruvannamalai","The forest way","Few hundred hectares","Cassine glauca","<a href=""http://www.theforestway.org/"">http://www.theforestway.org/</a>","347, Kananthampoondi village, Tiruvannamalai, 606603.","Maasilamani, Parasuraman, Vijaya, Jaya, Siva Kumar, Shyam","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/01-Atthenursery-ArunV-3.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/02-Sortingafterseedcollection-ArunV.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/03-Firefighting-ArunV.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/04-Plantingexercise-ArunV.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/05-Plantingexercise-ArunV.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/06-Plantingnativespecieswithinpitsthatweremadeearlier-ArunV.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/07-Restorationactivitiesnearthelake-ArunV.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/08-Plantingatpachaiyammantemple-ArunV.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/09-pachaiyammantemple-ArunV.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/10-Childrenhelpingwiththeplantingexercises-ArunV.jpg","arunachalaforestway@gmail.com","<p>To work towards restoration of the natural regions towards the ecological state pre destroyal</p>

"Ecological Restoration of Panchgani tableland","2083","The Asia Plateau or Panchgani tableland located in Panchgani hill station, is a famous tourist spot in Satara District of Northern Western Ghats. It is included in the Mahabaleshwar-Panchgani Ecosensitive Zone as a Conservation Zones and a Natural Heritage Site. Geology, geomorphology, flora and fauna of Panchgani tableland has been studied for more than a century. It was a popular summer tourism spot since British period. A number of hill streams originate from the plateau in monsoon and it has 2 perennial ponds. Additionally several small ephemeral pools form during monsoon on all the plateaus.

The Panchgani tableland has been floristically explored by the botanists for more than a century. It is type locality of six flowering plants (of which one is presumable extinct locally) and 2 freshwater fern species (Isoetes sp.) all of which are endemic to Western Ghats. It is also type locality of a freshwater Ostracode (an invertebrate), but its present status at the locality is unknown. It is also type locality of one lichen species and has around 20 lichen and moss species, of which many are Western Ghat endemic. 47 endemic species angiosperms and ferns are seen here of which 12 are rare and threatened. Malabar Lark an endemic bird is seen on the plateau. A grass, <em>Dichanthium panchganiensis</em>, an orchid <em>Habenaria panchganiensis</em>, a succulent <em>Euporbia panchganiensis</em> and lichen <em>Diorygma panchganiensis</em> have been named after Panchgani. It has two underground caves which are roosting place for bats.

Tourism took a severe toll on this plateau mainly due to its commercial, unplanned nature. Large parts of plateau were trampled, drove upon and lost the fragile vegetation cover. However, tourism is the main livelihood activity of this region and provides large revenue to local communities as well as Panchgani Municipal Council. Hence any activity of biodiversity and ecological protection has to be planned taking tourism into consideration.

Bombay Environmental Action Group provided the legal support in terms of various court orders that ensured the laws and policies for eco-sensitive zone and conservation zone are accepted by all the stakeholders and implemented on ground. At the same time consistent dialogue with local tourism entrepreneurs, Panchgani Council officers and tourists ensured that all are aware and proud of the natural values of the locality.

Scientific monitoring through student volunteers provided baseline data for conservation planning of this unique and challenging habitat. The area is divided into 3 zones- conservation zone, restoration zone and sustainable tourism zone with specific actions planned for ensuring survival of biodiversity in all zones. Indicators are identified in flora and fauna and a matrix is developed to ensure reduction in environmental impacts and gain of ecological values. The benchmark for the action project are historical records of past botanical inventories of the region, as there is no other comparable plateau in the region at present.

Trampling and illegal use of heavy vehicles was eroding the microhabitats and slowly converting the plateau to barren wasteland devoid critical vegetation cover.

"Mine restoration in Pandalgudi","2089","The afforestation of the exhausted limestone mines in Pandalgudi began in earnest in Dec 2018, after an initial site visit in August of the same year. Previous to this, over the previous 2 years, various pilot projects had been undertaken to assess the use of native species for this kind of work.The area of Pandalgudi is situated in a rain fall deficient area, as it falls in the rain shadow of the western ghats during the SW monsoon and of Sri Lanka in the NE monsoon. Annual rainfall is less than 500 mm, and the rainfall pattern is highly variable, with prolonged periods of drought, coupled with high summer temperatures, commonly above 40 degrees Celsius. The soil of the area is generally black cotton clay, with an underlying bed rock at varying depths. The water table has a high TDS value, around 2000 ppt, due to the presence of subsurface canker.

The mining areas are belonging to Ramco Cements, and had been mined during from the 1980’s for a period over 30 years. The limestone is found in a vertical seam, 10 – 18 meters wide, and is extracted by excavation of perpendicular benches, to a depth of around 60 meters. Consequently, the final width of the mined areas are around 130 meters wide. The superfluous excavated rocks are piled around the open mine and at the end of operations are generally backfilled as much as possible.

This work began in 2019 on 65 acres, but over the past 3 years has extend out to 350 acres, which will eventually over the next 5 to 10 years to over 850 acres. The plantation patterns are evolving over time as each successive year’s planting adds to our knowledge, and the availability of native species increases due to the development of an on-site nursery. Initially a number of non-native Nitrogen fixing species were included in the planting mix, however these have now been replaced with native species such as <em>Acacia leucophloea, Acacia chundra, Albizia amara, Albizia lathamii, Pterocarpus santalinus</em> and <em>Hardwickia binata</em>. Overall, we are now using over 75 native species of trees and shrubs in the plantations.

The eco type for this area is the southern thorn forest, and in the 2022 planting season there will be one area set aside for plantation exclusively with representatives of this forest type. Planting conditions in this area are severe due to the intense summer conditions and also due to the planting areas generally being on excavated rock piles. Pitting is carried out by mechanical means, and the holes are filled with black cotton soil that was removed from site prior to the mining activities. This soil is augmented with 1.5 kg of vermicompost at the time of planting, and again with 1kg when the rainy season returns. Plants are watered on average once a week for the first two years of establishment.

The results have been extremely rewarding with some species growing over one meter per year for the first three years. This is no doubt due in some part to the high level of aftercare, but is also thought to be a result of the loose nature of the soil allowing extensive root exploration.",,"2022-05-27 20:31:13","mine-restoration-in-pandalgudi","era_ad","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-AerialviewPhase1-ArjunSingh.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","Deccan thorn scrub forests","Tamil Nadu","2018–Ongoing","Pandalgudi, Virudhanagar, Tamil Nadu","Auroville Botanical Gardens","350 acres","Albizia lathamii,Balanites roxburghii,Salvadora persica","<a href=""http://www.auroville-botanical-gardens.org/"">http://www.auroville-botanical-gardens.org/</a>",,"Paul Blanchflower, Marie Demont, Silambuarasan, Adhikesavan","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1-Sitelookingnorthcopy-ArjunSingh-3.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-SitelookingwesttoPit1copy-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-entranceareaofsitecopy-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/5-Plantationin1stphaseafter24monthscopy-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6-AerialviewPhase1-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/7-Overviewof2ndphaseareacopy-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8-2ndphaseplantationafter12months-denseplantationmethodcopy-ArjunSingh.jpg","botanical@auroville.org.in","<p>Reforestation of exhausted mining areas.</p>

"Auroville","2092","The restoration of the Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest, within the township of Auroville has been an evolving process spread over the last 50 years carried out by numerous individuals who have been involved in the work. When the project started in 1968, the areas was a barren, eroded plateau. Many areas were devoid of topsoil, as the monsoon rains had washed it off, and created a wasteland crisscrossed with canyons. The first settlers planted a pioneer forest, a mix of species, in haphazard fashion without any real intention other than to create shade, arrest soil erosion and to create a habitable environment. Some native species were included in the mix, but it was the exotic species such as <em>Acacia auriculiformis</em> that dominated the forest areas by the mid-eighties.

However, by this time there was a growing interest in the local forests of the bioregion, small remnant temple groves and some areas of Reserve Forest. The exploration of these areas, and a more systematic approach to their study lead to the understanding that the native forest of the region was the Tropical Dry Evergreen Forest (TDEF). Concurrent with the studies, seed from these indigenous species were collected and grown in the nurseries. Over the next 20 years the process continued, and these species were planted out, both on new lands and as an understory in the previously established forest.

The TDEF is comprised of both evergreen and deciduous species, and so with the variety of niches present a mixed forest has established of over 250 native species of trees, shrubs, lianas and epiphytes. Presently there is a natural succession taking place as the exotic species from the original plantations are reaching the ends of their shorter lifecycles or succumbing to natural calamities such as cyclones. The underplanted native trees and shrubs are now emerging as the long term, permanent forest cover. The knowledge and skills assimilated during this long-term project are now being disseminated across India, as a variety of individuals involved in this work take up other afforestation projects.

Typical evergreen species that are now self-regenerating in the Auroville forests include <em>Diospyros ebenum, Chionanthus zeylanica, Memecylon umbellatum, Drypetes sepiaria, Walsura trifoliata, Aglaia elaeagnoidea, Tricalysia sphaerocarpa, Dimorphocalyx glabellus</em> and <em>Psydrax dicoccos.</em>",,"2022-05-27 20:31:15","auroville","era_ad","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-Wayin2022-ArjunSingh.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","East Deccan dry-evergreen forests","Tamil Nadu","1968–Ongoing","Auroville, Villupuram, Tamil Nadu","Auroville","3000 acres",,"<a href=""http://www.auroville.org/"">http://www.auroville.org/</a>",,"Extensive list of too many to mention","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/1-LandOct2000-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2-Firstplanting2000-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3-Wayin2022-ArjunSingh.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4-Densearea2022-ArjunSingh.jpg","botanical@auroville.org.in","<p>Restoration of tropical dry evergreen forest</p>

"Tropical forest restoration in the Eastern Himalaya","2098","We have been conducting extensive research on various aspects of hornbill ecology for over two decades in Arunachal Pradesh. The broader vision of this work is to see hornbill conservation and protection of their habitats, integrated into local community institutions, with our technical and scientific support. Restoring the degraded forest patches in Pakke Tiger Reserve (PTR) and the surrounding Reserved Forest (RF) for ensuring the availability of suitable hornbill habitat in the future, was one of the objectives of this broader goal. With this objective, the restoration project was initiated in 2014. It is being done in partnership with the Arunachal Pradesh Forest Department.

After the first two years of setting up a rainforest nursery in Seijosa, a fringe village of PTR, the planting activities began in 2016. Over the years, we have scaled up from growing 25 species to 75 species, which are important bird- and mammal-dispersed and mechanically-dispersed native tree species. From 2016 to 2021, we have planted 9617 saplings of 50-60 mixed species in 7.31 ha of degraded forest patches inside PTR and the RF.

Planting activities are carried out at the onset of the monsoon in May-June every year after identifying sites during the dry season. Planting is followed by maintaining and monitoring the sites. Maintenance is done by frequent weed clearing around the saplings during the first 2-3 years after planting. Monitoring progress involves collecting data on sapling survival and growth rate at an interval of 5-6 months. Our sites inside PTR and the RFs show 31-56 % survival after 2.5-3 years. Our recently published article provides critical information on the early-stage performance in terms of survival and growth of the native tree species which is needed to generate a preliminary list of species suitable for restoration (Borawake et al. 2021).

We have provided 3253 saplings to a few tea estates in nearby Assam state. Planting is done in open areas in the estates to increase shade and tree cover. The monitoring shows 69% survival after 2 years at these sites. The survival is higher than the forest sites as these areas are fenced, well-maintained, and wildlife activity is absent. We also encourage the participation of the local community in the restoration efforts and a certain proportion of saplings are sold at a nominal cost (Rs. 20/30) to the local people. The locals are dependent on the forests for timber and other forest resources. By growing these native species, they will be able to harvest timber in the future for subsistence and we hope this will eventually prevent tree felling in the forested areas.

We have also participated in and provided saplings for planting initiatives by various local organizations or the Forest Department. These saplings have been planted along the river banks, roadsides, schools and government office premises.

"Aravali Biodiversity Park","2101","The Aravali Biodiversity Park is 392 acres of wilderness carved out of a 40-year-old mining site in the millennium city of Gurugram. It was named as the first OECM (Other Effective area based Conservation Measure) in India under IUCN. The project started with a joint venture between the Municipal Corporation of Gurugram (MCG) and iamgurgaon (IAG). Now, the Park is managed by Hero Motocorp in association with the Rewilders.

The Aravali Biodiversity Park was a part of the Nathupur Village of Gurugram. Located at the Delhi-Gurugram border. This area was extensively mined for over 4 decades for the quartzite stone and Badarpur sand used for construction activities in Delhi-NCR. A large number of small stone quarries were operational in this area. The operation of 8 stone crushers on the Park land along with illegal felling of trees, cattle grazing and waste dumping had caused serious environmental degradation.

The Municipal Corporation of Gurugram ratified the vision of the Park as a City Forest showcasing native forest flora of the Northern Aravali. The ecological restoration work undertaken was guided by this vision and helped integrate ecology, urban environment and human aspirations in the city. In the year 2010, the Park was mostly barren and whatever little vegetation we saw was mainly young vilayati keekar (<em>Prosopis juliflora</em>), an invasive alien species that was colonizing the Park. One also noticed some seasonal herbs and grasses that came up during the monsoon and winter months.

At the start of the restoration work, rootstocks of native plants were identified and given protection. We saw a resurgence of babool (<em>Acacia nilotica</em>), ronjh (<em>Acacia leucopholea</em>), hingot (<em>Balanites roxburghii</em>), kair (<em>Capparis decidua</em>), ghatbor (<em>Fleuggea leucopyrus</em>) and jungli karonda (<em>Carissa spinarum</em>) from these rootstocks. While we protected these native species, we eradicated alien invasives, such as <em>Prosopis juliflora, Lantana camara, Xanthium stumarium, Parthenium hestrophorus</em> and many others.

Over 200 species of native plants (trees, shrubs, herbs, climbers, grasses) were added to the Park with a vision to showcase the forest flora. In the last ten years, the Park has become a favoured habitat for birds (over 201 species recorded) and wild animals (jungle cat, common palm civet, jackal, porcupine, neelgai and various kinds of reptiles) of Gurugram.

The forest community in the Park varies as per the terrain. The steep rocky outcrops are home to salar (<em>Boswellia serrata</em>) and dhok (<em>Anogeissus pendula</em>) forests, gentle outcrops house kumath (<em>Acacia senegal</em>) and khair (<em>Acacia catechu</em>) forests. Dhak (<em>Butea monosperma</em>) forest community on gentle slopes and dry valleys, and distinct forests of kaim (<em>Mitragyna parvifolia</em>) community in the seasonal drainage channels. Then the patches where the soil is deep, you find babool (<em>Acacia nilotica</em>) and jhand (<em>Prosopis cineraria</em>) forests, and seasonal wetlands have khajoor (<em>Phoenix sylvestris</em>) and Saccharum grasslands. Today these forest communities are established and many are recruiting individuals giving us hope that the Park is becoming a self-sustaining forest ecosystem.",,"2022-05-27 20:31:23","aravali-biodiversity-park","era_ad","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/SmallestCliff_2021_vijaydhasmana_small-VijayDhasmana.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","Aravalli west thorn scrub forests","Haryana","2011–Ongoing","Gurugram, Haryana","The Rewilders, IAMGURGAON, HMCL and MCG","157 hectares",,,"ARAVALI BIODIVERSITY PARK, MG Road, Gurugram, Haryana","Vijay Dhasmana, Atal Kapoor, Latika Thukral, Priti Sanwalka, Swanzal Kak Kapoor, Anjali Khatri","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN1-VijayDhasmana.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN_2-VijayDhasmana.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN_3-VijayDhasmana.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN_4-VijayDhasmana.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN_5-VijayDhasmana.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN_7-VijayDhasmana.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN_8-VijayDhasmana.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN_9-VijayDhasmana.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN_10-VijayDhasmana.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/ERN_13-VijayDhasmana-3.jpg","vijay.dhasmana@gmail.com","<p>Ecological restoration of a mines site</p>

"Rewilding former plantations and degraded forests","2104","Most of the Gurukula land has been clear felled in the past. Only 7 acres had primary forest with some selective removal of large trees. Previous have cultivated small farms, mostly coffee mixed with fruit trees and tea. Some hillsides also had lemongrass. Our collective has taken ownership of custodianship for these smallholdings a few acres at a time, and carried out various activities ranging from ex-situ conservation of Western Ghat species and rehabilitation of the same in habitats, to passive and active measures to recover degraded land to forest cover. Much of the rewilding land is left alone, and yearly lists are maintained of species presence. On 15 acres, tea has been removed. Since there are few opportunities to study what happens to land under different treatments, we believe it is important to document our wide-spectrum approach to ecological nurturance. We raise questions, intervene in small ways in a larger part of the land (60 acres), and in an intensive way in nurseries and habitats (15). Our concern for water bodies and not disturbing springs, and protecting from grazing and overharvesting has brought about the great diversity of species over time, and also texture of habitat. Mostly we are interested to ask questions and to observe. The land has powerful agents of transformation from the movement of animals, to quick spreading plants, and human beings who tend diversity, and heavy rainfall. In a tree based biome at 750 metres elevation, is it better to remove feral plantation crops in one shot, or is it better to phase them out, or perhaps even to leave alone? How do we gauge the health of the land: through presence of species, or climatic conditions of coolness, shade and protection? Does microbial diversity need to be taken into account? What about diversity of bryophytes and pteridophytes? And herbaceous flora? The forest has taken millennia to evolve to present day diversity and character, is time not a crucial factor? Meanwhile large scale conversion and clear-felling have dramatically affected habitat conditions. Are first responders of quick growing exotics, front runners for deep forest species? When tea is pulled out wholesale, are we regressing the habitat? When surrounded by heavily managed landscapes, is there need to rest the land, prior to restoration? Is Wedelia to be pulled out, or is it a deterrent to grazing, and will shade not eliminate it? Through observation, dialogue and some intervention, we have a rich landbase, and equally rich tangling narratives.",,"2022-05-27 20:31:25","rewilding-former-plantations-and-degraded-forest-in-western-wayanad","era_ad","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Gurukulayoungforestonformerlemongrassjpg-SuprabhaSeshan.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","South Western Ghats montane rainforests","Kerala","1973–Ongoing","Periya, North Wayanad, Kerala","Gurukula Botanical Sanctuary","75 acres","Cullenia exarillata,Cyathea spinulosa,Disperis zeylanica,Habenaria longicornu,Impatiens acaulis,Malaxis versicolor,Ophioglossum reticulatum","<a href=""http://www.gbsanctuary.org/"">http://www.gbsanctuary.org/</a>","Gurukula Botanical Sanctuary, Alattil P.

"Changlangshu Community Project","2107","Youth for Forest - led by Green Hub team and Green Hub fellows, aims to increase the fragments across the region for restoration through community participation and collaborative action. Currently there are two sites under this project and we hope to increase them over the years.

The effort began with creating small grants for our alumni who showed keen interest in working with conservation and with their community. Wanmei Konyak from Changlangshu village in Mon District, Nagaland was the first recipient of the grant. At the time he was an active member of the student council and through that had played a significant role in combating opium addiction in his area. In 2018 he took the initiative to form a Biodiversity Management Committee (BMC) in his village with the intention of creating a green corridor, looking at the severe deforestation and water crisis. The community is largely dependent on agriculture and he realised that if they do not work at reviving their forest, future for his community would be tough. It started with a small patch of Jhum fields for which the BMC got the permission from the village council. Over the last four years, they have planted more about 1500 saplings through community participation - involving different stakeholders in the village. The community now has committed to restore at least 100 hectares of land, and they are hoping to increase the fragments. A nursery is being developed for indigenous saplings.

The Youth for Forest project is also looking at developing these sites as a co -learning sites where the idea is to combine indigenous knowledge with scientific guidance from practitioners. As part of this a restoration workshop was held in collaboration with Nature Conservation Foundation (NCF). This was attended by the Green Hub alumni and their community members. As a result Wanmei's community has decided to stop the slash and burn technique that they were using for land preparation earlier. Through the Green Hub project every year video documentation is being done for these sites to create learning modules and stories.",,"2022-05-27 20:31:27","changlangshu-community-project","era_ad","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Plantation-ritabanerji-1.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","Northeast India-Myanmar pine forests","Nagaland","2018–Ongoing","Changlangshu Village, Nagaland","Dusty Foot Foundation, North East Network, BMC Changlangshu","Approximately 100 hectares in 2 fragments","Punyak,Choerospondias axillaris (Heemuk),Cotton Tree (Jaohpo),Tetrameles nudiflora,Borpat,Dhuna Tree,Teeta Chap,Elephant Apple Tree,Kari Badam,Rudraksha","<a href=""http://www.greenhubindia.net/"">http://www.greenhubindia.net/</a>","Jonak Kumargaon, Tezpur - 784001, Sonitpur, Assam, India.","Green Hub team, BMC Changlangshu Members, Youth for Forest","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/1.-Terrain_Changlangshu-rita-banerji-1.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2.Wanmai-Konyak-rita-banerji.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/3.-Initial-Condition_Changlangshu_2018-rita-banerji-1.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/4.-Restoration-Site_April-2022-rita-banerji.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Plantation-ritabanerji-1.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/6.-Restoration-work_2-rita-banerji.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/7..Nursery-rita-banerji.jpeg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/8.-Nursery-rita-banerji.jpeg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/9.-planting-saplings-rita-banerji-1.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/10.-Planting-sapling_Sedeng-Terang-rita-banerji-1.jpg","ritabanerji@gmail.com","<p>Scale up restoration work leveraging the power of local youth, community participation and collective action</p>

"Native Plant Garden at Dhodhakari","4875","The landowner and custodian Dr CS Agarwal started this project with the intention of ‘creating a forest’ as a form of ‘service to nature’. In the first 6-7 years he planted many exotic species, including an amla plantation. Most of these exotics struggled to survive in this soil and perished. He then got in touch with us in 2019 to help him restore the land. We carried out a survey of the vegetation and have been collecting seed and planting since our first monsoon on the site. We’ve learnt and grown along with the vegetation on the land. Our first year, we planted mainly trees and a few woody shrubs. Field trips to surrounding wild areas and farther west taught us that shrubs and grasses play a much larger role than trees in such an ecology. In our second year, we focused primarily on planting woody and herbaceous shrubs and grasses. As we enter the third year of planting, we’re excited about the annual wild flowers, grasses and desert shrubs we’ll be putting in the ground this year. The plants are in place and it’s only a matter of time before the landscape goes ‘pop’ and becomes visibly transformed.

Our site consists of a sandy bank abutting a stretch of low Aravalli hills running north to south. Government records assign this area as a ‘sandy plain’ of ‘aeolian’ origin but the maps are too vague to confirm this about our specific site. Our soil is a mix of sand and silt washed down from the abutting hills. The hill above our land is heavily mined and has slowly been worn away by dynamite, hammer and chisel in front of our eyes. Every now and then, rock projectiles careen onto the western edge of the land, sometimes damaging our plants. The ecology consists of elements from both, the sandy plains of western Rajasthan and moister northern Aravalli hill forests. We’re growing a number of “roee” plants — species typically from the shrublands of the Thar. These include bui (<em>Aerva javanica</em> &amp; <em>A. pseudo-tomentosa</em>), senio (<em>Crotalaria burhia</em>), kheemp (<em>Leptadenia pyrotechnica</em>), <em>Sericostoma pauciflorum</em> and many others. We’re also growing grasses especially adapted to the sandy desert like murat (<em>Panicum turgidum</em>) and sevan (<em>Lasiurus sindicus</em>). We were especially fortunate that we had Kishanbagh closeby, a mature restoration site with similar site conditions. This served as a site analogue for us to mimic, especially since our project budgets didn’t allow for extensive field trips farther into the desert. The Kishanbagh nursery also provided us plant material, seed, and know-how. We benefited greatly by applying a technique they developed called ‘seed-bearing soil’ — collecting small amounts of soil ‘impregnated’ with seed from intact or semi-intact wild areas. This has borne surprising results for us.

"Experiments in restoring Prosopis-invaded grasslands","4908","In 8 villages across the Banni, we set up experimental plots to monitor grassland recovery under the two prevailing Prosopis-management methods practiced by local communities, removal and lopping (for charcoal). (Although Banni has traditionally been a landscape used by pastoralists, many people have now come to depend for their livelihoods on charcoal made from Prosopis. We thus wanted to see whether—apart from Prosopis removal—such a ‘control-through-utilization’ of Prosopis could also result in grassland recovery between lopping cycles.)

In each village, in addition to the Prosopis-removal and lopping plots, we also had control plots where Prosopis remained. Apart from this, we had four reference grassland plots across the Banni. Each year from 2016 to 2019, following the monsoon, we monitored the regeneration of herbaceous vegetation to record changes in vegetation cover and species richness. We also monitored regeneration of Prosopis and weeded out Prosopis seedlings appearing in the plots.

Over the 4-year period we saw a significant increase in herbaceous vegetation cover and species richness in the Prosopis-removal plots, compared to the controls. (There was no significant recovery of grassland vegetation in the lopped plots, however, presumably because the lopped Prosopis grew back too rapidly to allow for it.) The increased herbaceous vegetation in the Prosopis-removal plots comprised annual and perennial forbs, annual grasses, and sedges, but lacked the perennial grasses that were dominant in the reference grasslands. The absence of perennial grasses could be because they failed to disperse to these sites, or because conditions were not conducive for their establishment. A next step would be to try and introduce perennial grasses and monitor their success.

We were unable to extend this experiment beyond 2019. Our Sahjeevan team-members have, since then, extended this work by carrying out larger scale Prosopis removals (3800 ha in total) across the Banni, in collaboration with the local pastoralist association (BPUMS), and in consultation with village elders in 21 of Banni’s villages. In addition to monitoring these sites for grass and herbaceous species regeneration, and Prosopis regeneration (and re-removal), they have dispersed grass seeds in these sites as an additional intervention.",,"2022-06-23 12:22:25","experiments-in-restoring-prosopis-invaded-grasslands","arjun@ncf-india.org","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Remote-open-grazing-land_AN-Ankila-Hiremath.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","Aravalli west thorn scrub forests,Rann of Kutch seasonal salt marsh","Gujarat","2016- 2019","Banni grasslands, Kutch district, Gujarat",,"0.96 ha spread over 8 locations","Dactyloctenium aegypticum,Desmostachya bipinnata,Dichanthium annulatum,Eragrostis ciliaris,Ischaemum travancorense,Sporobolus coromandelinius,Urochondra setulosa",,,"Pankaj Joshi, Ritesh Pokar, Nirav Mehta, Chetan Misher, Mayur Bhagwat","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/11-Reference-Vaadas_AN-Ankila-Hiremath.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/17-Ashish-Nerlekar-Chetan-Misher-surveying-herbaceous-regeneration_2016-Ankila-Hiremath.jpeg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/13-Prosopis-woodland_NM-Ankila-Hiremath.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/12-Prosopis-woodland_NM-Ankila-Hiremath.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/15-Tractor-mounted-device-for-uprooting-Prosopis_AH-Ankila-Hiremath.jpeg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/14-JCB-uprooting-Prosopis_ATV-Ankila-Hiremath.jpeg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/16-Uprooting-Prosopis-with-tractor-mounted-device_AH-Ankila-Hiremath.jpeg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/18-Herbaceous-regeneration_2019_NM-Ankila-Hiremath.jpg","hiremath@atree.org","<div class=""xMZTse Ih4Dzb"">

"Project Krishna Leela (Rewilding)","4946","This project began in early 2022 when NIIT University (NU) invited Pradip Krishen to help them restore a large swathe of village common land adjacent to the campus. The landscape comprises wind-swept sand dunes abutting the eastern face of a slate-ey group of Aravalli Hills. NU had already been trying to ‘green’ the area by planting lots of trees. They use an elaborate system of tanks and drip-irrigation pipes to keep these inappropriate trees alive. Pradip suggested that we begin restoration in small sections of both sandy and rocky areas so that we can train the local team and show them what’s possible with native plants. NIIT agreed to this.
The project began in March’22. Since then we’ve done a preliminary survey of the vegetation, started collecting seed; set up our nursery; dug pits and are readying to plant up our first two sites this monsoon. We hope these will serve as ‘models’ that the local team can use to restore the rest of the landscape. Since this is a village common land that’s used for grazing, it should be interesting to see how we protect our plants until they establish and whether we can institute a system of rotational grazing in dialogue with the locals.",,"2022-06-23 14:55:37","project-krishna-leela-rewilding","arjun@ncf-india.org","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/IMG_9061-Somil-Daga.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","Aravalli west thorn scrub forests","Rajasthan","2022- Ongoing","Neemrana, Alwar, Rajasthan",,"The larger landscape under the University’s stewardship is over 200 acres.

NIIT University, over the last few years, has taken the initiative to plant lots of trees, but they have mostly planted thirsty species that require irrigation and constant care.

"Ranwa","5012","This project is part of Northern Western Ghats in state of Maharashtra. It is in the village of Van-Kuswade from Satara district. This 24 acre land is owned by film actor Atul Kulkarni, actor Dhiresh Joshi and their families. As a first step, we surveyed the entire watershed of Van Kuswade village, understood the stream network, geology, and studied the forests and Sacred Groves (Devrai), biodiversity distribution within the catchment just to understand current natural set up of the surrounding area and its relation with the project land.

Specific restoration techniques were designed for the restoration of land as mentioned above. As a result of all these techniques, the biomass on the ground started increasing. This has changed the physical structure of land. Soil erosion is reduced as soil is arrested behind the stone bunds and stone lines. Rainwater seepage has increased. Another striking difference was observed in improved the soil temperature from 56 °C to 40 °C, which is most important for many microbes so that they can thrive in it even after monsoon. The land, which used to get dry quickly after the previous rains, now retains moisture for a long time, till April-May. The land which was covered only with seasonal grasses has now layer of perennial grasses which insulates the land throughout summer till next monsoon. Seeds of many native plants started germinating naturally. A beautiful mosaic of habitats with grassy patches, shrub clusters, and perennial vegetation can be seen today on the land which has been dry and open for years. We look at species and their activity as an ‘indicator’. Birds have started to nesting and breeding indicating creation of safe sites and enough food for them. Increased number of reptiles and lizards are indicating increased insect population. Flora and micro fauna is the base of the food chain. Birds of preys also indicate the establishment of complete food chain. Occurrence of rare animals such as Sicilians, Leeches are also using the land indicating restoration of specific habitats for them which were completely absent in initial years.

From all these observations, it can be said that habitats and diversity on this land patch has improved. Interestingly, the neighbouring patch of the land is still at the same stage the way it was 15 years back. So comparison is easy. Project land has climbed up one or two stages on the ladder of ecological succession, which is a process of going towards maturity of ecosystem. The project seems to be on a right path of forest formation. It is difficult to say how long it will take may be twenty years, maybe even fifty. As the owner of land, Atul says, “... all this is for nature and for future generations. Let’s try and give back to nature and enjoy this process !”",,"2022-06-24 17:49:22","ranwa","arjun@ncf-india.org","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Van-Kusawade-Restoration-project-Oikos-Ecological-Services-1.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","North Western Ghats moist deciduous forests",,"2006- Ongoing","Van Kusawade, Satara, Maharashtra",,"24 Acres",,,,,"https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Changes-in-land-over-14-years-at-Ranawa-Oikos-Ecological-Services.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/6.-Native-plantations-Oikos-Ecological-Services.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/7.-Loose-boulder-bund-for-erosion-control-Oikos-Ecological-Services.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/8.-Erosion-control-gully-results-over-years-Oikos-Ecological-Services.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/10.-Soil-temperature-Oikos-Ecological-Services.jpg",,"<div class=""xMZTse Ih4Dzb"">

"Shola-Grassland Restoration in the Nilgiri Plateau","5123","The Nilgiri plateau located at the juncture of the Western and Eastern Ghats covers an area of over 2200 square kilometres. It has an average elevation of close to 2000m and was once covered by the shola-grassland mosaic ecosystem. However, less than 10 percent of this ecology now remains in an intact state. This entire ecosystem is home to close to 1,200 species of plants, with several being endemic. It is hugely important to restore this ecology both to safeguard this specialized biodiversity here and improve the overall ecological security of this biosphere. Apart from various other benefits and natural cycles supported by this ecology and this landscape, millions of people and life-forms living downstream depend on the services of this region.

We at Upstream Ecology are working to increase the space for this endangered eco-type, all across the plateau. The shola-grassland mosaic community of plants are under immense pressure especially because they are marginalized by all the key ecosystem pressures such as, habitat loss and fragmentation, global warming and climate change and invasive species spread.

At the core of Upstream Ecology is a native plant nursery, where we grow over 80 species of native plants, herbs, shrubs and trees. Along with the guidance from Gurukula Botanical Sanctuary, Wayanad and Vattakaanal Conservation Trust, Kodaikanal, we started one of the first grassland nurseries in this region. Our primary focus is on growing the montane-grasslands and shrubland type ecosystems back. Within this, we also focus on the endangered wetland ecology, and reviving streams and stream flows back. We also work on growing back shola forests back, by following techniques that help their survival better. Another measure we take is to try and grow back the community structure together, such as the ecotone species between shola and grasslands, understory plants, and a wide number of tree species.

At Upstream Ecology we work with all the stakeholders in the Nilgiri Biosphere Reserve. The local forest departments, municipal bodies, other administrative bodies, NGOs such as Keystone Foundation and Clean Coonoor, schools, institutions and private land holders. One of our projects has been in introducing native species into peoples’ homes and private lands. We promote the concept of conservation gardens, where we try and communicate the ornamental value of native plants shrubs and trees, along with all their other ecological benefits and importance. Along with this ground-level work, which has been on for close 10 years, we have also been working to communicate the importance of preserving this ecology with all the stakeholders, children and people all over.",,"2022-06-25 16:44:40","shola-grassland-restoration","arjun@ncf-india.org","publish","https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Kurinji-pan-inv-red.jpg",,"standard","open","closed",,"0","0","South Western Ghats montane rainforests","Tamil Nadu","2013- Ongoing","The Nilgiris",,"267 acres in 21 fragments","Eriochrysis Rangacharii (Endemic to Nilgiris),Glochidion neilgherrense","<a href=""http://www.upstreamecology.org/"">http://www.upstreamecology.org/</a>","159, Peyton's Road, Ooty, 643001, The Nilgiris, Tamil Nadu",,"https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/b-f-stream-restoration_UE-post-Godwin-Vasanth-Bosco.jpg,https://era-india.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Pine-Romoval-composite-Godwin-Vasanth-Bosco.jpg","vasanth@upstreamecology.org","<div class=""xMZTse Ih4Dzb"">

"Garo Green Spine Conservation Project","5433","Spanning across 8000 sq.km, and as part of the Indo-Burmese biodiversity hotspot, the Garo Hills in the state of Meghalaya support an incredibly rich biodiversity. The Garo Hills Elephant Reserve has three protected areas, a reserve forest and five elephant corridors, which together link around 1500-1700 elephants. The project area is also part of the proposed Garo Hills Conservation Area (GHCA) proposed for inclusion in World Heritage site by the Indian Government. Interestingly, only 7-8% of the forested area in the Garo Hills is under the control of the Meghalaya Forest Department; the remaining area is owned by local communities under the management and jurisdiction of the Garo Hills Autonomous District Council (GHADC).

Unscientific mining and age-old practices such as slash-and-burn cultivation or jhum have been drivers of deforestation and fragmentation hindering the movement of wildlife and leading to human-wildlife conflict. To address this, Wildlife Trust of India, with support from partners, has been working with the local council (GHADC) and the state forest department for almost two decades to secure and restore the forest patches located between West Garo Hills and Nokrek National Park with a view to establishing wilderness connectivity with Balpakram National Park (BNP) which is titled as the Garo Green Spine forming the backbone of biodiversity of the region. As a result of these collaborative efforts, two main elephant corridors in the region (Siju- Rewak and Rewak-Emangre corridors) have already been secured and local communities have further voluntarily set aside and protected close to 4200 hectares of land as 20 Village Reserve Forests (VRFs). Efforts are on to secure the remaining two corridors (Baghmara-Balphakram and Nokrek-Emangre) through the same approach.

In addition to this, an area of 340 hectares of degraded forest patches have been restored through plantation and Assisted Natural Regeneration. This is an affirmation of the indigenous rights, self-government and community empowerment creating a multi-level impact resulting in not just wildlife habitat protection but also a positive social impact on the communities with regards to their livelihood and lifestyle.

","<p>Degraded, devoid of natural vegetation, and reduced soil fertility. Poor land use, unsustainable cultivation practices like Jhum, over grazing and exploitation of shared forest resources are disturbances that have existed in the past and some of which continue to, but have substantially been regulated over the years in the project sites due to project’s efforts</p>
","<p>In 2009, we initiated a habitat restoration project that led to restoration of 190 hectares of jhummed (Slash and burned cultivation) and fallow land in Garo Hills.</p>
<p>Between 2009 and 2012, we undertook the restoration activities with annual survival count measured. Periodic de-weeding and gap filling in previous years helped in good survival of the plants as well as regeneration of new plants in the restoration area. The no. of different species was also calculated during the annual plantation count. In the second phase of the restoration project, 150 hectares of degraded lands were restored via the same approach in South Garo Hills between 2019-21</p>
<p>Through the restoration project, a total of 340 hectares of degraded forest lands were restored with over 350,000 standing trees belonging to approx. 150 native species across community forests of 16 villages.</p>
<p>The protection of the restored area by the members of local communities has been the main reason for this success. Watchers have been appointed from the community for regular monitoring of these restoration sites and to protect them from trespassers and livestock. The watchers also organize village coordination meetings to discuss local conservation issues and engage them in periodic de-weeding for removal of invasive weeds. Hand de-weeding of these restoration sites are done every year until the trees come to mature in 5-6 years. These engagement activities have financially supported 300 – 350 villagers with 40% youth and 60% elders.</p>
<p>Local species of vegetation were also staging a comeback as the protection and conservation regime improved over the years</p>
<p>Biodiversity assessment of the restored sites is also carried out and information collated along parameters indicating health of the forest ecosystem. This serves as an indicator to measure the success of the restoration work done</p>

"D'ering-Dibru Saikhowa Elephant Corridor Project","5440","One of the most important elephant landscapes of India is in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh supporting over 25% of the 27000 odd elephants currently present in India (MoEFCC 2017). However, the landscape is also dominated by enormous human populations which have resulted in degradation and fragmentation of the elephant habitats and escalated human-elephant conflict. One of the vital corridors in this landscape of the 18 corridors in Assam and Arunachal Pradesh is the D’ering-Dibru Saikowa Corridor connecting elephant populations of Pasighat and D’ering Wildlife Sanctuary in Arunachal Pradesh with Doomdooma Forest Division and Dibru Saikowa National Park, Assam supporting approx. 450-500 elephants.

Human settlements, biotic pressure and increased human elephant conflict in the corridor called for a need to secure this corridor on priority. WTI’s work is helping to secure this corridor with local community and State Forest Departments since 2019 by ‘Connecting Landscapes, Empowering People and Protecting Elephants’. This will involve setting aside critical part of corridor land as “Community Reserve” (CR), restoring degraded corridor habitats, sensitizing locals and garnering their support for wildlife conservation, providing green livelihood options to local communities, building capacity of and empowering the management authorities, managing Human-Elephant Conflict situations and deploying local community based organizations as Green Corridor Champions. The aim is to create a win-win situation for elephants, locals and administrative authorities in the landscape.
In its 3 years of functioning the project has achieved the following successes:
<ol>
 	<li>Approximately 1200 hectares of community forest land committed for protection as Community Reserve</li>
 	<li>Over 600 families from beneficiary villages benefitted from enhance livelihood activities</li>
 	<li>50 hectares of degraded forest lands restored in efforts to enhance ecological connectivity of the landscape</li>
 	<li>Equipment support in form of sleeping bags, field bags etc provided to frontline staff of D’ering Wildlife Sanctuary and Dibru Saikhowa National Park</li>
 	<li>Human elephant conflict (HEC) mitigation strategies implemented in the landscape by providing immediate relief to affected local communities, solar fence installation to reduce crop raiding and formation of local response teams for safe passage of elephants</li>

","<p>In the first phase of restoration undertaken in the project area in 2021, 50 hectares of degraded land was identified within the corridor to be restored through plantation of mid-late successional tree species. A total of 44382 saplings of 31 tree species, representing 27 genera and 20 families were planted. Hand-weeding was done to remove undesired (alien) plants from the planting landscape. Any chopped vegetation (weeds) was removed from the planted landscape. This method was designed to mimic the weed control methods used by forest managers in the field. For all species, the average survival percentage of saplings after one year of planting was 42.07%. We planted individual level contributions of saplings with an average value of 3.22 percent across all species to preserve biodiversity in the restoration design and ensure that no one species could dominate others. Out of the total tree species, 29% of species had a high survival rate, 45% had a medium survival rate, and 26% had a low survival rate. With the assistance of local communities and watchers, the plantations are being protected. The designated guards belong to the local communities and keep an eye on the restoration area and protect it from trespassers and cattle. In order to discuss regional conservation concerns, the guards regularly conduct village coordination meetings.</p>
<p>Biodiversity assessment of the restored sites is also carried out and information collated along parameters indicating health of the forest ecosystem. This serves as an indicator to measure the success of the restoration work done and how this is facilitating connectivity for wildlife</p>
<p>Other activities: Dung encounter rate monitoring for assessing elephant movement patterns, assessing survival rate of saplings, setting permanent plots for long-term ecological monitoring, documenting the biodiversity, community support, awareness campaigns, capacity building for forest department staff</p>

<div class=""Mh5jwe JqSWld yqQS1"" aria-describedby=""c1266"">As a first milestone for the Alliance, we crafted a scientific evidence-based roadmap with the most credible data for the Government of India to achieve its sequestration target. This includes nearly 10 million hectares (10MHa) of degraded cropland and 1MHa each of degraded riparian habitats and open natural ecosystems in peninsular India. We also took a closer look at the classification of degradation and understood that some of the categories must be evaluated for their ecological value and other forms of ecosystem restoration must be introduced to move away from the mainstream narrative of merely tree-planting being promoted by the state. Additionally, co-benefits such as maintenance of hydrological cycles, biodiversity conservation, livelihoods, and nutritional security must not be ignored.</div>
